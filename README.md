A basic wordpress theme base for compiling styles using SASS.

To use, follow the instructions on how to set up COMPASS on your computer [here](http://compass-style.org/install/). 

After that is installed, you are ready to begin. 

In the command line, navigate to the assets folder and watch the SASS folder for changes.

```php
$ compass watch sass
```
Now you are ready to edit the SCSS files.

Press Ctrl+C to stop following.
